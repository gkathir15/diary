The following assertion was thrown during performResize():
I/flutter (12400): Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.
I/flutter (12400): Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container.In this case, a vertical
I/flutter (12400): viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. This situation
I/flutter (12400): typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.
I/flutter (12400): If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because
I/flutter (12400): there will always be enough vertical space for the children. In this case, consider using a Column
I/flutter (12400): instead. Otherwise, consider using the "shrinkWrap" property (or a ShrinkWrappingViewport) to size
I/flutter (12400): the height of the viewport to the sum of the heights of its children.
